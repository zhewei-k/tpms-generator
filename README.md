# TPMS GENERATOR READ ME

TPMS Generator is a script developed by Zhe-Wei Kho, under the supervision of Vee San Cheong. This was developed with the objective of improving the efficiency of developing optimised TPMS scaffolds for implants. This project was proudly supported by the University of Sheffield's Undergraduate Research Scheme (SURE) 2024 for its initial development between July 2024 and August 2024.

TPMS Generator makes use of Ansys PyMAPDL and nTop Automate to enable iterations to be completed seamlessly. These come in the form of:
- list processing
- secant method root finding
- as well as mesh convergence capabilities

Run times can vary between 15 minutes up to 2 hours.

For a full list of libraries used in this script, please refer to *requirements.txt*
