tpms_generator_v2 is a script developed by Zhe-Wei Kho, under the supervision of Vee San Cheong. This was developed with the objective of improving the efficiency of developing optimised TPMS scaffolds for implants as part of SURE Scheme 2024.

Version 2 of this script makes use of Ansys PyMAPDL and nTop Automate to enable iterations to be completed seamlessly. These come in the form of:
- List processing, and
- Secant method root finding

Run times can vary between 15 minutes up to 2 hours.

Bug fixes:
- updated strain in compression, previously was not accurate as multiplying by number of specimens is inacurrate.

For a full list of libraries used in this script, please refer to requirements.txt
